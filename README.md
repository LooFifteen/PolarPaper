#### Polar world format for Paper

> [!WARNING]  
> Not widely tested, possibly unstable. Backup your worlds before if you don't want to lose them!

Polar is a world format very similar to Slime, with the same advantages:
 - Small file sizes
 - Single file world
 - Immutable (Worlds do not save until explicitly requested)
 - Store worlds wherever (Whether as a file or in a database)

Polar is also a single plugin without requiring classloaders or a Paper fork

Polar was originally developed for [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom), see the Minestom loader [here](https://github.com/hollow-cube/polar)
